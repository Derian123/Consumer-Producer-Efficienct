# Consumer-Producer-Efficienct
This program uses 2 different scenarios to find which would be more efficient

Scenario one uses 2 producer arrays where a consumer thread can consume from either array using a random number generator to generate the randomness
Scenario two uses 2 consumer arrays where a producer thread produces in the array with the least amount of elements
